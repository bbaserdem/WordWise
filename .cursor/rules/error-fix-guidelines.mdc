# Refactoring principles

- Whenever you change the contents of a function, scan the codebase for every occurence of the function and make sure the new workflow doesn't break any existing functionality.
- Follow linting rules when applicable while refactoring code.
- Always think about downstream effects of refactoring a portion of code, before changing any code. Make sure to prioritize not breaking any existing functionality.

# Error fix principles

- When you encounter a build error, perform a scan of all possible locations that other occurrences of this error in the project might be encountered.
- When an error is reported, first scan all occurences of the source of the error, and plan to fix the error without reintroducing it elsewhere.

# New feature principles

- Whenever a new feature is implemented, scan the codebase to see if any previously hardcoded parts can be adapted to use this new feature. Give a report on these locations before adapting to new implementation. Ask for confirmation before you start adapting.
