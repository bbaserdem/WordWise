## Deliverables

- ✅ Working Next.js application with TypeScript
- ✅ Firebase integration with authentication
- ✅ Basic project structure following project rules
- ✅ Minimal responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Development and production deployment pipeline
- ✅ Basic authentication flow (login/register)

### 6. Development Infrastructure

**Goal**: Establish complete development and deployment pipeline

**Tasks**:

1. Set up Firebase emulators for local development
2. Configure environment variables and secrets management
3. Create development setup scripts and automation
4. Set up Firebase security rules and database indexes
5. Implement basic error tracking and monitoring

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Firebase emulators run locally for Auth, Firestore, and Storage
- Environment variables are properly configured and validated
- Development setup script automates environment preparation
- Security rules protect user data appropriately
- Basic error handling and logging is functional

**Implementation Notes**:

- Emulators configured for Auth (port 9099), Firestore (port 8080), UI (port 4000)
- Development setup script checks dependencies and environment
- Firestore rules implement proper user-based access control
- Database indexes optimize common queries
- Error boundaries catch and display errors gracefully

### 7. Test Data Setup

**Goal**: Establish realistic test data for development and testing

**Tasks**:

1. Import markdown test files from `_example` directory into database
2. Create seed data script for populating test projects and documents
3. Set up test user accounts with sample data
4. Implement data import functionality for markdown files
5. Create test scenarios for different document types and content

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- All 6 markdown files are successfully imported as documents
- Seed script populates database with realistic test data
- Test users have access to sample projects and documents
- Import functionality handles markdown formatting correctly
- Test scenarios cover various academic writing styles

**Test Data Sources**:

- `_example/0-intro.md` - Introduction to neural networks
- `_example/1-connclone.md` - Connectome encoding research
- `_example/2-mapseq.md` - Mapping and sequencing methods
- `_example/3-odor_navigation.md` - Olfactory navigation studies
- `_example/a1-reinforcement_learning.md` - RL concepts
- `_example/a2-neural_networks.md` - Neural network architectures

**Implementation Notes**:

- Import script creates test project with all 6 documents
- Documents are properly categorized by type (introduction, chapter, appendix)
- Test user account provides realistic development environment
- Markdown parsing preserves academic formatting and structure
- Seed data is idempotent and safe to run multiple times

## Technical Implementation

### Core Dependencies

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "^14.0.0",
    "react": "^18.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.0.0",
    "firebase": "^10.0.0",
    "typescript": "^5.0.0"
  },

    "tailwindcss": "^3.0.0",
    "@types/react": "^18.0.0",
    "@types/node": "^20.0.0"
  }
}
```

### Key Files to Create

- `app/layout.tsx` - Root layout with authentication context
- `app/(auth)/layout.tsx` - Authentication layout
- `app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` - Dashboard layout
- `lib/firebase/config.ts` - Firebase configuration
- `lib/auth/auth-context.tsx` - Authentication context
- `components/layout/header.tsx` - Application header
- `components/layout/sidebar.tsx` - Navigation sidebar
- `types/auth.ts` - Authentication type definitions
- `types/project.ts` - Project type definitions

### Database Schema

```typescript
// Users collection
interface User {
  uid: string;
  email: string;
  displayName?: string;
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  updatedAt: Timestamp;
}

// Projects collection
interface Project {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  type: 'dissertation' | 'research-paper' | 'other';
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  updatedAt: Timestamp;
}

// Documents collection
interface Document {
  id: string;
  projectId: string;
  userId: string;
  title: string;
  content: string;
  version: number;
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  updatedAt: Timestamp;
}
```

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Application builds and deploys successfully
- ✅ Authentication flow works end-to-end
- ✅ Users can create projects and documents
- ✅ Basic text editing and saving works
- ✅ Development environment is fully functional
- ✅ All code follows project rules and conventions
- ✅ Test data is properly imported and accessible

## Risk Mitigation

- **Firebase Setup**: Use emulators for development to avoid costs
- **Authentication**: Implement proper error handling for auth failures
- **Data Loss**: Ensure auto-save works reliably before proceeding
- **Performance**: Monitor bundle size and loading times
- **Security**: Implement proper Firestore security rules

## Definition of Done
