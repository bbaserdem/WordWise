# Phase 1: Setup - Barebones Foundation

## Overview
This phase establishes the foundational structure for WordWise, creating a minimal running application with basic project setup, authentication, and core infrastructure. The goal is to have a functional but basic application that can be built upon in subsequent phases.

## Phase Goals
- Set up the complete development environment
- Establish basic project structure and routing
- Implement core authentication system
- Create minimal UI framework
- Ensure the application runs and deploys successfully

## Deliverables
- ✅ Working Next.js application with TypeScript
- ✅ Firebase integration with authentication
- ✅ Basic project structure following project rules
- ✅ Minimal responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Development and production deployment pipeline
- ✅ Basic authentication flow (login/register)

5. Create basic user profile management

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Users can register with email/password
- Users can log in and log out
- Authentication state persists across sessions
- Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users
- Basic user profile information is accessible

### 3. Basic Navigation & Layout
**Goal**: Create the fundamental navigation structure and layout system

**Tasks**:
1. Design and implement responsive header component

3. Set up breadcrumb navigation system
4. Implement basic page layouts (auth, dashboard)
5. Add loading states and error boundaries

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Navigation works on mobile and desktop
- Sidebar collapses and expands properly
- Breadcrumbs show current location
- Loading states appear during navigation
- Error boundaries catch and display errors

### 4. Project Management Foundation
**Goal**: Establish basic project and document management structure

**Tasks**:
1. Create project data models and Firestore collections
2. Implement basic project CRUD operations
3. Create project listing and creation pages
4. Set up document data models and basic operations
5. Add basic project navigation and routing

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Users can create new projects
- Projects are saved to Firestore
- Project listing displays user's projects
- Basic project navigation works
- Document structure is established

### 5. Basic Writing Editor
**Goal**: Create a minimal but functional text editor

**Tasks**:
1. Implement basic text editor component
2. Add auto-save functionality
3. Create document version history system
4. Set up real-time document synchronization
5. Add basic document export functionality

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Users can create and edit documents
- Documents auto-save every 30 seconds
- Version history tracks manual saves
- Documents sync in real-time
- Basic export to plain text works

### 6. Development Infrastructure
**Goal**: Establish complete development and deployment pipeline

**Tasks**:
1. Set up Firebase emulators for local development
2. Configure environment variables and secrets
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment
4. Create development and production Firebase projects
5. Implement basic monitoring and error tracking

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Emulators run locally for development
- Environment variables are properly configured
- Automated deployment works
- Production environment is stable
- Basic error tracking is functional

## Technical Implementation

### Core Dependencies
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "^14.0.0",
    "react": "^18.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.0.0",
    "firebase": "^10.0.0",
    "typescript": "^5.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "firebase-tools": "^13.0.0",
    "eslint": "^8.0.0",
    "prettier": "^3.0.0",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.0.0",
    "@types/react": "^18.0.0",
    "@types/node": "^20.0.0"
  }
}
```

### Key Files to Create
- `app/layout.tsx` - Root layout with authentication context
- `app/(auth)/layout.tsx` - Authentication layout
- `app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` - Dashboard layout
- `lib/firebase/config.ts` - Firebase configuration
- `lib/auth/auth-context.tsx` - Authentication context
- `components/layout/header.tsx` - Application header
- `components/layout/sidebar.tsx` - Navigation sidebar
- `types/auth.ts` - Authentication type definitions
- `types/project.ts` - Project type definitions

### Database Schema
```typescript
// Users collection
interface User {
  uid: string;
  email: string;
  displayName?: string;
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  updatedAt: Timestamp;
}

// Projects collection
interface Project {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  type: 'dissertation' | 'research-paper' | 'other';
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  updatedAt: Timestamp;
}

// Documents collection
interface Document {
  id: string;
  projectId: string;
  userId: string;
  title: string;
  content: string;
  version: number;
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  updatedAt: Timestamp;
}
```

## Success Metrics
- ✅ Application builds and deploys successfully
- ✅ Authentication flow works end-to-end
- ✅ Users can create projects and documents
- ✅ Basic text editing and saving works
- ✅ Development environment is fully functional
- ✅ All code follows project rules and conventions

## Risk Mitigation
- **Firebase Setup**: Use emulators for development to avoid costs
- **Authentication**: Implement proper error handling for auth failures
- **Data Loss**: Ensure auto-save works reliably before proceeding
- **Performance**: Monitor bundle size and loading times
- **Security**: Implement proper Firestore security rules

## Definition of Done
- All acceptance criteria are met
- Code passes all linting and type checking
- Tests are written for critical functionality
- Documentation is updated
- Application is deployed to production
- Team can successfully run and develop locally

## Next Phase Preparation
This phase establishes the foundation for Phase 2 (MVP), which will add:
- Real-time grammar and spell checking
- Enhanced writing editor with suggestions
- Improved project and document management
- Better user experience and polish
