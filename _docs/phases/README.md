## Development Approach

### Iterative Development

Each phase delivers a working product that can be used by end users. This approach allows for:

- Early feedback and validation
- Risk mitigation through incremental delivery
- Continuous improvement based on user input
- Faster time to market with core features

### Feature Integration

Features are designed to work together cohesively:

- Each phase builds upon the previous foundation
- New features integrate seamlessly with existing functionality
- User experience remains consistent across phases
- Technical debt is minimized through proper planning

### Quality Assurance

Each phase includes:

- Comprehensive testing requirements
- Performance benchmarks
- Security considerations
- Accessibility compliance
- Documentation standards

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success

- Application runs without errors
- Users can authenticate and create projects
- Basic text editing and saving works
- Development environment is fully functional

### Phase 2 Success

- Grammar and spell checking works reliably
- Visual feedback system is intuitive
- Writing experience is distraction-free
