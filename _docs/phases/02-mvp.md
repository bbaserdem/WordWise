## Testing Strategy

### Test Data Utilization

The MVP phase will extensively test all features using the markdown test files from the `_example` directory:

**Grammar and Spell Checking Tests**:

- Test with `0-intro.md` and `1-connclone.md` for academic writing patterns
- Verify suggestion accuracy with complex scientific terminology
- Test edge cases with mathematical notation and citations

**Suggestion System Tests**:

- Use `2-mapseq.md` and `3-odor_navigation.md` for diverse content testing
- Test suggestion categorization with different writing styles
- Verify confidence scoring with various error types

**Editor Performance Tests**:

- Load large documents like `2-mapseq.md` (33KB) to test performance
- Test real-time checking with `a1-reinforcement_learning.md` and `a2-neural_networks.md`
- Verify auto-save functionality with complex formatting

**Export Functionality Tests**:

- Test DOCX export with all markdown files
- Verify LaTeX export preserves academic formatting
- Test with documents containing equations and special characters

### Test Scenarios

1. **Academic Writing Flow**: Import test documents and verify grammar checking works
2. **Suggestion Management**: Test accept/ignore functionality with real content
3. **Performance Testing**: Load large documents and measure response times
4. **Export Testing**: Export all test documents to different formats
5. **Edge Case Testing**: Test with documents containing special characters and formatting

### Quality Assurance

- All features tested with realistic academic content
- Performance benchmarks established using test data
- User experience validated with actual writing scenarios
- Accessibility testing with screen readers and keyboard navigation

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Visual suggestion system is intuitive and responsive
- ✅ Writing editor provides distraction-free experience
- ✅ Suggestion sidebar effectively manages all suggestions
- ✅ Project management features improve workflow

## Risk Mitigation

- **Grammar Service**: Implement fallback to basic checking if service fails
- **Performance**: Use debouncing and caching for real-time checking
- **Data Loss**: Ensure suggestions are saved with documents
- **User Experience**: Test with real academic writing scenarios
- **Accessibility**: Conduct accessibility audit and testing

## Definition of Done
