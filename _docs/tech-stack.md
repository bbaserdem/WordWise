# Tech Stack Documentation

## Overview

This document defines the complete technology stack for WordWise, a writing assistant for STEM graduate students. The stack is designed to work seamlessly on NixOS while maintaining compatibility with other development environments.

## Development Environment

### Language & Runtime

- **TypeScript** - Primary development language
  - Static typing for better code quality and developer experience
  - Excellent IDE support with autocomplete and refactoring
  - Self-documenting code with interfaces and types

#### TypeScript Best Practices

- Use strict mode in `tsconfig.json` for maximum type safety
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use union types for better type narrowing
- Implement proper error handling with custom error types
- Use generic types for reusable components
- Avoid `any` type - use `unknown` or proper typing instead
- Use utility types like `Partial<T>`, `Pick<T>`, `Omit<T>`
- Implement proper async/await patterns with error handling

#### TypeScript Limitations & Pitfalls

- Runtime type checking still needed for external data
- Bundle size increases with type definitions
- Learning curve for complex generic types
- Potential performance impact with complex type operations
- Type definitions may be outdated for third-party libraries

#### TypeScript Conventions

- Use PascalCase for interfaces and types
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Prefix interfaces with 'I' only when necessary for clarity
- Use descriptive names for generic type parameters
- Export types from dedicated type files

### Package Management

- **pnpm** - Node.js package manager
