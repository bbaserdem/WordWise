# Project Overview

WordWise is a writing assistant web app for STEM graduate students drafting their dissertations or research papers.
It offers real-time grammar, clarity, and citation feedback in a distraction-free editor tailored to academic writing.

## Testing Data

For local development and testing, the project includes a set of converted markdown files in the `_example` directory. These files were converted from LaTeX academic documents and serve as realistic test data for the writing assistant features:

- **Source**: LaTeX files from academic research documents
- **Format**: Converted to clean markdown with preserved structure
- **Content**: Academic writing covering neuroscience, machine learning, and research methodologies
- **Usage**: Import into the database for testing grammar checking, AI suggestions, and document management features

### Test Files Available
- `0-intro.md` - Introduction to neural networks and brain connectivity
- `1-connclone.md` - Encoding and retrieval of connectome data
- `2-mapseq.md` - Mapping and sequencing methodologies
- `3-odor_navigation.md` - Olfactory navigation research
- `a1-reinforcement_learning.md` - Reinforcement learning concepts
- `a2-neural_networks.md` - Neural network architectures

These files provide diverse academic content for comprehensive testing of the writing assistant's capabilities.
